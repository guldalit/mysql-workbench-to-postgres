The script receive a sql script file, originated by Mysql Workbenchs and
converts it to a PostgreSQL script compatible. The export is made by 
Forward Engeneer SQL CREATE script option. The following options can't be
marked:
-Generate Separate CREATE INDEX Statments
Some of the options were not tested yet. The running syntax is:
